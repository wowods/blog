When we hear about an open-world game, we often to imagine a vast world where we could control the player to go wherever and to do whatever we want right at the beginning of the game, or at least after we finished the tutorial. And with a big world, of course it will have an epic story and journey, with a lot of items and equips that you could acquire, with a lot of enemies and bosses with their unique skill sets, there’s a lot of things that you could do on this big open world game. To simply put, you could explore the world to your heart content.  
But, what if I say that an open-world game doesn’t need to have a big map to be good? Let me introduce you to A Short Hike, a short open-world game that despite the game’s title, is not just about hiking, but more about exploring the small island.

But how A Short Hike make a small world is enjoyable to be explored?

### Conversation with NPC

For me, one of the reason is how the NPC is designed in this game. 
While on the big open world game we often found a lot of NPCs whom just strike a meaningless conversation, on A Short Hike each conversation with an NPC always bring something to you, either it just give you a direction, some quest or task, or even a new thing to do. That’s why, it’s very interesting when you see somebody in the game that you never encounter before, because you know that he/she had something for you. Since the NPC also spread across the island, this could be a motivation for you, the player, to explore the island to meet all the NPCs and unlock a lot of content of the game. Of course there’s also some meaningless NPC with their meaningless dialogue, but it just a small percentage compare with the meaningful NPC on this game. 

In this game, conversation with the NPC strike fluidly that quite fits the theme of the game. Some of them are goofy, but quite often the conversation is going kinda serious, talking about their problem and worry to you. This feels like conversation that could happens naturally in the real world. Probably because the set up of the game is quite similar with our current real world rather than on some fantasy-medieval setting that we never really been in. 

For example, when we helping the rabbit to find her lost red headband (her name is Sue, btw) you could see how she kept on insisting the headband is bring her luck to win the race and she doubt that she could run the race without it. But after we found the headband and asking about the lucky-headband, she admitted that probably the reason she winning is not because of luck and she just being so nervous and worry if all of it was just a fluke. In the end, she accept that she doesn't need luck to win the race and giving up her lucky headband to us.  
This conversation, where she told us about her worries and after some deliberation she finally moving on from her worries, feels natural like a conversation between to close friend. And maybe, because most of the conversations in this game are like this, where it feels genuine and natural, make us feel like helping our friends, rather than just doing a task or quest, hence will add a motivation for you to do the side-quest.

### How the quest is designed

My next point is about the quest. The quest in this game often designed to have multiple part and often inter-connecting with each other. This will make the side-quest feels interesting and different with one another, despite most of them are basically a fetch quest. For example, when we meet one of the campers that lost his permit, he bribed us by giving us bait and later told us that a fish ate it. Since the camper located in the beginning section of the game, most of us not yet getting a fishing rod when this conversation is happened. Probably, you already realize when seeing the ocean or some pond, there's a fish silhouette floating around and this conversation ensure that we could go fishing in this game (and hopefully, caught a fish that eaten the camper's permit). Thus, our quest to find ~~the camper's permit~~ how to fish is begin. Even after you get the fishing rod and caught the fish that ate a permit, you'll find yourself on another fishing quest where you are trying to catch and sell every type of fish that available on the island.    
This structure on the quest make the player keep going to find a new thing to do in the game, while motivate them to keep exploring the island.  

Of course not all the quests in A Short Hike are like this. But the combination of the conversation and how the quest is design, really make the whole experience fantastic.

### Exploring the island

The last thing that I want to explained are how good the feeling to exploring the island in this game.  
Why? One of the reasons is about the movement, especially the flying movement in this game that really feels amazing. You will heavily rely on flying since when you master it, it could help you to reach much more quickly. The flying movement feel so fluid and the music while you flying is so soothing, that make the experince so satisfying.  

The music also have an important role in this game. If you listen carefully, the music in A Short Hike could dynamically changes based on you location. Aside from giving you the perfect vibe during your exploration, the music also could lead you by make you realize that you're entering or leaving an area.

Another aspect are how the game lead you while you're exploring.  
For example sometimes there're some coins that will lead you to somewhere. These coins are deliberately placed that could makes the player to follow along it and find the point of interest that hopefully could spark their interest for exploring more.  
Talking about point of interest, beside using a trails of coins to lead you to certain places, the game also put binoculars in some place that will help you to found another point of interest, like a lighthouse, a silhouette of faraway island, or an intriguing colums of air.

1. About the NPC and the conversation, not just generic NPC and simple quest
2. How the quest is designed, some of them are not a single tasks to be done but chained task that we need to be doing one by one. Plus, it will have “multiple” solution.
3. How they force you to follow something, by using coins, by adding “interesting point”, etc.
4. Combination of quest with interesting story and conversation is intriguing. eg: the child that asks you to collect 20 shells or the painter quests or the sand-castle kid.
